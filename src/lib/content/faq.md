## What is Kirtan Kriya meditation and what makes it unique for potential Alzheimers prevention?

Kirtan Kriya is a 12-minute meditation technique from Kundalini Yoga that involves chanting the mantra "Saa Taa Naa Maa" while simultaneously performing specific finger movements (mudras) and visualizing the sound flowing in an "L" shape through the head. Kirtan Kriya is unique due to its combination of sound, touch (through the fingertips), visualization, and a set duration. Research suggests that this multi-sensory approach activates specific brain regions, increases cerebral blood flow, and provides multiple benefits in a short amount of time (12 minutes daily), making it easy for aging individuals to learn and practice.

## What is the basic method of Kirtan Kriya?

The basic method of Kirtan Kriya meditation involves five specific actions in addition to maintaining a comfortable posture and focusing concentration. It is a multifaceted, multisensory exercise that takes only one 12-minute session a day and can be performed by individuals of any age with or without memory loss, sometimes with appropriate supervision.

Here are the key components of the basic method:

- **Posture:** Sit comfortably in a chair with feet flat on the floor or on the floor, maintaining a straight spine with its natural curvature.
- **Breath:** Allow the breath to come naturally throughout the meditation.
- **Eyes:** Keep the eyes closed during the practice.
- **Sound (Mantra):** Chant the sounds "Saa Taa Naa Maa". This mantra symbolizes the cycle of life: birth, life, death, and rebirth. The tune used for these sounds is the first four notes of "Mary had a Little Lamb".
- **Hand Position and Finger Movements (Mudras):** With the hands on the knees, touch the thumb to each of the other four fingers in a specific sequence simultaneously on both hands:
  - **On "Saa"**, touch the index fingers to the thumbs (Gyan Mudra).
  - **On "Taa"**, touch the middle fingers to the thumbs (Shuni Mudra).
  - **On "Naa"**, touch the ring fingers to the thumbs (Surya Mudra).
  - **On "Maa"**, touch the little fingers to the thumbs (Buddhi Mudra). The sequence always moves forward (index to middle to ring to pinky) and never backward.
- **Focus of Concentration (Visualization):** Visualize the sound coming down from the top of the head and out the middle of the forehead in the center, lined up with the nose like a capital letter "L". This can be thought of as a sweeping motion.
- **The Sequence and Timing:** The 12-minute meditation progresses through the following stages:
  1. Sing the mantra out loud for two minutes.
  2. Sing in a stage whisper for the next two minutes.
  3. Say the mantra silently to yourself for the next four minutes.
  4. Whisper the mantra for two minutes.
  5. Sing the mantra out loud for the final two minutes. A timer or watch should be used instead of an alarm.
- **Coming Out of the Exercise:** Inhale deeply through the nose, stretch your hands above your head, and then bring them down slowly in a sweeping motion as you exhale through the nose. Take a couple of deep nasal breaths before opening your eyes and resuming activity.

When outside thoughts intrude, simply return your focus to the sounds and visualization. This multifaceted approach engages auditory, tactile, and visual senses

## How does stress contribute to the risk of Alzheimers?

Chronic stress has significant negative biochemical effects on the body and brain, which are implicated in the development of Alzheimers. Research shows that stress can diminish telomerase levels, an enzyme crucial for maintaining the protective caps of DNA called telomeres. Shorter telomeres are associated with inflammation, accelerated aging, and an increased risk of Alzheimers. Furthermore, chronic psychological distress has been linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimers disease in older age.

## What specific cognitive and psychological benefits have been associated with Kirtan Kriya practice?

Studies on Kirtan Kriya have shown improvements in memory in individuals with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. Beyond cognition, Kirtan Kriya has been linked to reduced stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improved sleep quality. Participants practicing Kirtan Kriya have also reported increased psychological well-being or spiritual fitness, which is considered important for maintaining cognitive function and preventing Alzheimers.
