## **What is Kirtan Kriya, and how can it help prevent Alzheimer’s?**

Kirtan Kriya is a simple, 12-minute meditation from Kundalini Yoga that involves:

- **Chanting** the sounds "Saa Taa Naa Maa"
- **Touching** your fingers in a specific pattern
- **Visualizing** the sound moving through your head

This unique combination of sound, movement, and focus has been shown to **improve brain function, reduce stress, and increase blood flow to the brain**. Research suggests that practicing Kirtan Kriya daily may help **slow memory loss and reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease**.

## **How do I practice Kirtan Kriya?**

Kirtan Kriya is easy to learn and can be done sitting in a chair or on the floor. Here’s how:

### **1. Get Comfortable**

- Sit with your back straight, either in a chair with feet flat on the floor or cross-legged on the floor.
- Rest your hands on your knees, palms facing up.
- Close your eyes and breathe naturally.

### **2. Chant the Mantra**

You will repeat the sounds **"Saa Taa Naa Maa"** in a rhythm. These sounds represent the cycle of life: birth, life, death, and rebirth.

- **Say them out loud** for 2 minutes.
- **Whisper them** for 2 minutes.
- **Say them silently in your mind** for 4 minutes.
- **Whisper them again** for 2 minutes.
- **Say them out loud** for the final 2 minutes.

### **3. Move Your Fingers (Mudras)**

As you chant each sound, touch your fingers to your thumb in this order:

- **"Saa"** – Touch your index finger to your thumb.
- **"Taa"** – Touch your middle finger to your thumb.
- **"Naa"** – Touch your ring finger to your thumb.
- **"Maa"** – Touch your little finger to your thumb.

Repeat this pattern throughout the meditation.

### **4. Visualize the Sound**

Imagine the sound **entering through the top of your head and exiting through the middle of your forehead** (between your eyebrows) in an "L" shape.

### **5. Finish Gently**

- Take a deep breath in through your nose.
- Stretch your hands above your head.
- Slowly bring them down as you exhale.
- Take a couple of deep breaths before opening your eyes.

If your mind wanders, simply return your focus to the sounds, finger movements, and visualization.

## **How does stress affect Alzheimer’s risk?**

Chronic stress can damage the brain and increase the risk of Alzheimer’s. It lowers levels of an important enzyme called **telomerase**, which helps protect our DNA from aging. Stress also causes inflammation and speeds up brain aging.

Kirtan Kriya helps **reduce stress, lower inflammation, and promote relaxation**, all of which support brain health.

## **What are the benefits of Kirtan Kriya?**

Studies show that practicing Kirtan Kriya daily can:

- ✅ **Improve memory** and focus
- ✅ **Reduce stress, anxiety, and depression**
- ✅ **Enhance sleep quality**
- ✅ **Increase feelings of well-being and inner peace**
- ✅ **Support brain health and possibly lower Alzheimer’s risk**

## **How long before I see results?**

Many people notice a sense of calm and clarity **after just one session**. However, for long-term brain health benefits, it’s best to practice **daily for at least 8-12 weeks**.

## **Do I need any special equipment?**

No! All you need is **a quiet space and 12 minutes a day**. This timer can help keep track of the different stages, but there’s no need for alarms or music.
