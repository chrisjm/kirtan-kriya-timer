# Playwright Test Plan for Kirtan Kriya Timer

This document outlines the test plan for the Kirtan Kriya Timer application using Playwright. The checklist format tracks implementation progress.

## Setup and Configuration

- [x] Configure Playwright with TypeScript
- [x] Set up test fixtures and helpers
- [x] Configure coverage reporting
- [x] Integrate with SvelteKit's routing

## Core Test Categories

### A. Timer Functionality Tests

#### Timer Initialization
- [x] Timer loads with correct default values
- [x] Initial phase is set correctly
- [x] Time display shows the correct format
- [x] Timer status indicators display correctly

#### Timer Controls
- [x] Start button begins the timer countdown
- [x] Pause button stops the timer countdown
- [x] Reset button returns timer to initial state
- [x] Timer countdown decrements correctly
- [ ] Phase progression occurs automatically when time expires
- [ ] Completion state and confetti display when meditation completes

#### Phase Selection
- [x] Manual phase selection changes current phase
- [x] Phase information updates when phase changes
- [ ] Phase completion indicators update correctly
- [x] Phase duration reflects interval multiplier settings

### B. Audio Functionality Tests

#### Audio Initialization
- [x] Audio enable button initializes audio context
- [x] Audio initialization state persists between sessions
- [x] Audio initialization state is reflected in UI

#### Sound Controls
- [x] Volume slider changes volume level
- [ ] Mute toggle button mutes/unmutes audio
- [x] Mantra pace control (BPM slider) changes playback speed
- [ ] Mantra pitch controls change note pitches
- [x] Sound settings persist between sessions

#### Wake Lock Functionality
- [ ] Wake lock is requested when timer starts
- [ ] Wake lock indicator displays correct state
- [ ] Wake lock is released when timer stops
- [ ] Wake lock is reacquired when page regains visibility

### C. UI and Accessibility Tests

#### Responsive Design
- [x] Layout adapts to mobile viewport sizes
- [ ] Layout adapts to tablet viewport sizes
- [ ] Layout adapts to desktop viewport sizes
- [x] UI components maintain functionality across viewport sizes

#### Accessibility
- [x] Keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements
- [x] ARIA attributes are present and correct
- [x] Focus management follows logical flow
- [x] Color contrast meets accessibility standards
- [ ] Screen readers can access all relevant information

### D. State Management Tests

#### Store Integration
- [x] Timer store updates correctly with timer actions
- [x] Sound store updates correctly with audio actions
- [x] Navigation store persists state between page navigations
- [x] Stores interact correctly (e.g., timer affects sound playback)

#### Local Storage
- [x] Settings persist between sessions
- [x] Phase progress is saved and restored
- [x] Volume and mute settings persist
- [x] Interval multiplier setting persists

## Implementation Status

### Implemented Test Files
- **basic.test.ts**: Basic functionality tests for initial app validation
- **test.ts**: Core timer functionality and audio tests
- **state.test.ts**: State management and local storage persistence tests
- **ui.test.ts**: UI, accessibility, and navigation tests
- **helpers.ts**: Comprehensive test helpers with improved error handling and timeouts
- **coverage-helper.ts**: Coverage reporting tools

### Test Helper Improvements
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging
- Increased timeouts for reliability (DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 10000ms)
- More robust selectors with fallback strategies
- Conditional test skipping for environment-specific tests

### Coverage Reporting
- [x] JSON coverage report generation
- [x] Markdown report generation with file-level metrics
- [x] Identification of areas needing more coverage
- [x] Integration with test:coverage script

## Future Test Improvements

### Priority 1: Complete Core Functionality Tests
- [ ] Test phase progression automation
- [ ] Test meditation completion state
- [ ] Test wake lock functionality

### Priority 2: Enhanced Audio Tests
- [ ] Mock audio context for consistent testing
- [ ] Test mute toggle functionality
- [ ] Test mantra pitch controls

### Priority 3: Comprehensive Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility tests
- [ ] Complete responsive design tests for all viewport sizes

## Coverage Goals

- [x] >80% coverage of component functionality
- [x] >80% coverage of store actions
- [x] >70% coverage of utility functions
- [x] Track and report coverage metrics

## Notes

- Tests are independent and do not rely on state from other tests
- Playwright timeouts have been increased (test: 60000ms, expect: 15000ms)
- Wake lock testing requires special handling for browser compatibility
- Current focus is on completing core functionality tests before expanding to edge cases
